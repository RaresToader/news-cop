- Continuously researched the topic of overlaping detections, decided on some open-source frameworks / libraries we are going to incorporate in our backend application
- Discussed, as a team, about technical decisions related to DBMS that will be used and how we will aproach obtaining the news articles and storing their fingerprints.
- Each member when through React and Django tutorials to become more familiar with the stack.

## Questions for the TA

- Do we need to include "won't haves" into the requirements?
- Check if we correctly cite research publications / articles
- Show TA the Moscow methodology and incorporate his feedback. 
- Should we add more requirements / split the current requirements into smaller sub-requiremenets? 
- Discuss with the TA about our DBMS decision: Relational vs NoSQL for storing documents’ fingerprints?
- Are we going to store the “date” as it is (not integrate it in fingerprint & then discard)
